Cologne, Germany. The CalConnect Test Event (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
morning) and Conference (Wednesday afternoon, Thursday and Friday) were held at
Komed House, a conference facility in the Cologne Media Park.</p>
<p id="_d7cbe720-bc5f-438d-ae17-5d41d812bed6">The CalConnect Conference was attended by 20 people from 12 members plus a
guest from GFI. The Test Event/Developers Forum had 10 participants from 7
members and was largely devoted to the forum and CalDAV Tester rather than specific
testing.</p>
<p id="_dff2fee6-e725-4ff0-94c7-8524bd9f9700">The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing
work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The
Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect
XL Conference Schedule.</p></introduction></preface><sections>
